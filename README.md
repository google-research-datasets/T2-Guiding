# T2-Guiding

T2 Guiding is a dataset of 1000 images, each with six image labels. The images are from the Open Images Dataset (OID) and we provide 2 sets of machine-generated labels for these images.

1) Object labels: Three random object labels generated by a FRCNN model trained on Visual Genome.
2) Image labels: Three random image labels obtained from Google Cloud Vision API.

This dataset is used as the test set in the paper: "Understanding Guided Image Captioning Performance across Domains".
